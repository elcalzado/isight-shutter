These are my notes from beginning to end as I was figuring out how it worked.

Red cable: Power
Black cable: GND

No continuity between GND/Power and Shared/Left/Right.

Measured resistances (FireWire unplugged, other modules connected):
- GND->Shared: 1.793 kOhm
- GND->Left: 148.7 Ohm
- GND->Right: 5.749-5.855 kOhm (Varied within that small margin)
- Power->Shared: 119.6 kOhm
- Power->Left: 116.9 kOhm
- Power->Right: 142.3 kOhm
- Shared->Left: 798 Ohm
- Shared->Right: 4.043 kOhm
- Left->Right: 6.004-6.094 kOhm (Varied within that small margin)

There are two resistors on the mainboard that are wired as follows: 
- GND->R1->Right
- GND->R2->Left

Shared pin connects the set of pins on Sony D2450R 546 C39V marked on the [image](https://ibb.co/h1V9wPgf).

Based on the probing and the [datasheet for the D2450R](https://www.alldatasheet.net/datasheet-pdf/view/47003/SONY/CXD2450R.html) the shared pin connects to +3.3V.

Left and Right pins do not connect to anything on the D2450R.

Shared/Right pins connect to the DSP TMS320DSC25 CB 5CA33JJ ZHK chip. Unsure to what pins exactly since all the contacts are super tiny.

Shared is connected to a few pins along the sides of TMS320DSC25. Unable to determine what those pins do. Should be +3.3V based on previous measurements.

Right is connected to a pin on the bottom of the TMS320DSC25. Unable to determine what that pin is though.

Voltages in open position (black probe on first node):
- GND->Shared: 3.035 V
- GND->Left: 1.884 V
- GND->Right: 0.004 V
- Left->Shared: 1.167 V
- Right->Shared: 3.000 V
- Right->Left: 1.852 V

Voltages in open position (black probe on first node):
- GND->Shared: 3.062 V
- GND->Left: 1.894 V
- GND->Right: 2.919 V
- Left->Shared: 1.168 V
- Right->Shared: 0.143 V
- Right->Left: -1.025 V

Figured it out! The sensor is wired as follows:
+3.3V->Shared->Collector->Emitter(Right)->R1(~5.7-5.9 kOhm)->GND
+3.3V->Shared->Anode->Cathode(Left)->R2(~150 Ohm)->GND


Right pin is HIGH (~3V) when the shutter is closed and LOW (~0V) when it's open.
